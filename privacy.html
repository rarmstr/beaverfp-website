            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 27, 2025</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h2>Your Privacy is Our Priority</h2>
                <p><strong>Your financial data never leaves your device.</strong> Beaver FP is designed with privacy at its core - all your data lives exclusively in the app and never leaves your device.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Information Collection and Storage</h2>
            <p>Beaver FP operates on a fundamentally different model than most apps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or financial information.</li>
                <li><strong>100% Local Storage:</strong> All your financial plans, personal information, and calculations stay exclusively on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>No Servers:</strong> There is no central database at Beaver FP. We don't have servers, and we cannot see your data.</li>
                <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How Your Data is Protected</h2>

            <h3>Local-Only Architecture</h3>
            <p>Your data is stored using Apple's secure local storage systems on your device. This architecture provides superior privacy because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Network Attacks:</strong> Your data cannot be intercepted or hacked remotely since it never travels over the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>No Data Breaches:</strong> We cannot lose what we don't have access to.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> You decide when to delete or export your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Access:</strong> No internet connection required to access your financial plans.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Apple Security Features</h3>
            <p>Your data benefits from Apple's industry-leading security features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App Sandbox:</strong> Your financial data is isolated from other apps. Each app runs in its own secure sandbox, preventing unauthorized access to your Beaver FP data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> When your device is locked, your data is automatically encrypted using hardware encryption. Even with physical access to your device, your financial information cannot be read without authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Face ID or Touch ID can protect access to the app. Your biometric data never leaves the Secure Enclave on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Enclave:</strong> Sensitive operations are processed in a dedicated security coprocessor, providing hardware-level protection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. iCloud Backup (Optional)</h2>
            <p>If you choose to use iCloud backup on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Beaver FP data may be included in your device's iCloud backup.</li>
                <li>This backup is <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong> by Apple.</li>
                <li>Apple cannot access your backed-up Beaver FP data.</li>
                <li>You control iCloud backup settings in your device's Settings app.</li>
                <li>We do not have access to your iCloud account or backups.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Beaver FP integrates with the following Apple services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> For app distribution and updates. Subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>StoreKit (In-App Purchases):</strong> For subscription management. Apple processes all payment information. We never see your credit card or payment details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Data Rights</h2>
            <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete any financial plan or all data instantly from within the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Export:</strong> You can export your plans in standard formats for portability.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Privacy:</strong> We never ask for unnecessary permissions or data.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Transparency:</strong> This privacy-first approach will never change.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Beaver FP is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since all data is stored locally on the device, parents have complete control over their child's use of the app.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page</li>
                <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date</li>
                <li>Providing notice within the app if changes are material</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your continued use of Beaver FP after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

            <h2>8. International Users</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. Your data stays in your country, on your device.</p>

            <h2>9. Data Security Best Practices</h2>
